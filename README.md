# Cyclistic Bike Share Data Analysis
**Google Data Analytics Capstone Project Using SQL & Tableau**

## Overview
This project is a detailed case study analyzing the **ride-sharing patterns** of a bike-sharing company. The goal is to understand how different user types—**casual riders** and **annual members**—utilize the service and how the company can optimize its operations for better customer retention and revenue growth. 

The analysis focuses on identifying key trends in user behavior, such as **ride duration**, **peak usage times**, and **seasonal variations**. By leveraging **SQL** for data extraction and **Tableau** for visualization, the study aims to provide actionable insights that can help the company make data-driven business decisions.

Through this project, we aim to answer critical business questions such as:
- What are the differences in riding behavior between casual users and annual members?
- When do users ride the most, and how does seasonality impact usage trends?
- How can the company convert more casual riders into paying subscribers?

The findings from this study will help the bike-sharing company improve its services, enhance the user experience, and increase profitability by targeting key customer segments more effectively.
